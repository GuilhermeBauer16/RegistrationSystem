## Learnings


In this project, I learned new things related to Java and databases.
I learned how to create a Maven project, set up the archive pom.xml, and understand fundamental 
concepts related to JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate. These concepts were considerably simpler 
compared to JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). I also achieved the knowledge of how to set up the persistence.xml
file related to the database.

## Funcionalities

  * Customer name.
  * Age.
  * Phone.
  * E-mail.
